### 🎯 Good First Issues

New to the project? Look for issues labeled `good-first-issue`. These are specifically chosen to be approachable for newcomers.

### 📝 Documentation

Documentation improvements are always welcome! This includes:
- README improvements
- Code comments
- API documentation
- Tutorials and guides
- Translation to other languages

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+ and npm
- **MongoDB** 6.0+ (local or MongoDB Atlas)
- **Python** 3.9+ (for ML service)
- **Git** for version control
- **React Native CLI** (for mobile development)

### Setup Your Development Environment

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub

2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Tally_sync.git
   cd Tally_sync
   ```

3. **Add the upstream repository**:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL-OWNER/Tally_sync.git
   ```

4. **Run the quick setup script**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x quick-setup.sh
   ./quick-setup.sh
   ```

5. **Configure environment variables**:
   - Edit `backend/.env` with your MongoDB connection and API keys
   - Edit `ml-service/.env` with ML service configuration
   - Edit `mobile/.env` for mobile app development

6. **Start the development servers**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Branch

Always create a new branch for your work:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/bug-description
# or
git checkout -b docs/documentation-update
```

Branch naming conventions:
- `feature/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation changes
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `test/` - Adding or updating tests
- `chore/` - Maintenance tasks

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Write clean, readable code
- Follow the existing code style
- Add tests for new features
- Update documentation as needed
- Keep commits focused and atomic

### 3. Test Your Changes

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific service tests
npm run backend:test
npm run frontend:test
npm run mobile:test

# Run integration tests
npm run test:integration
```

### 4. Commit Your Changes

Follow our commit message guidelines (see below).

### 5. Keep Your Branch Updated

```bash
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main
```

### 6. Push to Your Fork

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### 7. Create a Pull Request

Go to GitHub and create a pull request from your fork to the main repository.

## Coding Standards

### JavaScript/Node.js

- Use **ES6+** syntax
- Follow **ESLint** configuration
- Use **async/await** instead of callbacks
- Use **meaningful variable names**
- Add **JSDoc comments** for functions
- Keep functions **small and focused**

Example:
```javascript
/**
 * Fetches user data from the database
 * @param {string} userId - The user's unique identifier
 * @returns {Promise<Object>} User object
 */
async function getUserById(userId) {
  try {
    const user = await User.findById(userId);
    if (!user) {
      throw new Error('User not found');
    }
    return user;
  } catch (error) {
    logger.error('Error fetching user:', error);
    throw error;
  }
}
```

### Python (ML Service)

- Follow **PEP 8** style guide
- Use **type hints**
- Add **docstrings** to functions and classes
- Use **meaningful variable names**

Example:
```python
def predict_payment_delay(invoice_data: dict) -> dict:
    """
    Predicts the likelihood of payment delay for an invoice.
    
    Args:
        invoice_data: Dictionary containing invoice details
        
    Returns:
        Dictionary with prediction results and confidence score
    """
    # Implementation
    pass
```

### React/React Native

- Use **functional components** with hooks
- Follow **React best practices**
- Use **PropTypes** or **TypeScript** for type checking
- Keep components **small and reusable**
- Use **meaningful component names**

Example:
```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

const UserProfile = ({ userId }) => {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchUser(userId);
  }, [userId]);

  // Component logic
};

UserProfile.propTypes = {
  userId: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
};

export default UserProfile;
```

### File Organization

- Keep related files together
- Use clear, descriptive file names
- Follow the existing project structure
- Create index files for cleaner imports

## Commit Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification.
